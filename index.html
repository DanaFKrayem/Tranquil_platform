                            are more likely
                            to
                            develop depression. Researchers followed 145 high-risk teens and found that those who felt
                            less
                            pleasure from rewards were more likely to experience their first episode of depression. This
                            finding could help identify at-risk teens and lead to early interventions</p>

                            method could help doctors respond quickly to mood episodes, improving treatment for patients
